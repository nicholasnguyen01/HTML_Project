            <h3 id="headline">Here's an excerpt timeline of Arminius' Life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>c. 18 BCE</b> - Arminius was born the eldest son of the Cherusci chief Segimer.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Most likely he and his brothers <i>(after being raised in Rome as a hostage)</i> fought beside the legions under Tiberius Claudius Nero, stepson of Emperor Augustus, suppressing the huge Pannonian and Illyrian revolts. </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>~8 CE</b> - Arminius was transferred to the Rhine to serve under Governor Publius Quinctilius Varus. Varus' mission was to turn Germania Magna (Greater Germany), the tribal territories east of the Rhine, into a full-fledged Roman province. Although the Cherusci had received federated status within the Roman Empire, to Arminius it was clear that his people were not treated as equals.</li>
                <br>
                <li>To defeat the legions, Arminius united the tribes. He would lure Varus and his legions into the Teutoburg Forest. There the difficult terrain favored Arminius' lighter-armed, quick and nimble Germanic warriors.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest took place.</li>
                <br>
                <li>News of the destruction of three legions reached Emperor Augustus along with the head of Varus, courtesy of Maroboduus. An irate Augustus shouted, <b>"Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions"</b>. In light of the disaster in the Teutoburg, the Clades Variana, Augustus abandoned the conquest of Germania. </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
           
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Arminius' victory in the Teutoburg forest kept the Germanic tribes free of Roman dominion. Centuries later, their freedom would make possible the emergence of the nations of Germany, France, and England."</p>
